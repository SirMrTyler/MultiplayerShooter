# MultiplayerShooter

I Would highly suggest browsing through each commit (specifically the ones labelled by version) to read discriptions of what was changed, and how it was changed. Doing so will give you a better understanding of my workflow and development practices (if you're unfamiliar with how, see image below).

If You would like to try a specific version I have playable builds for each one (see image below for how to access them).
